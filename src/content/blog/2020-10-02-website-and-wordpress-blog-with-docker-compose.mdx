If you are creating your own personal website, take a look to this post ðŸ˜‰

Weâ€™ll see together how to create a **secure website** and serve a **wordpress** blog on the same domain.

## 1. The concept
Letâ€™s take a look to the concept behind this method.

<Image src={flowDiagram} alt="project-flow" />

Weâ€™ll use a Nginx server for redirect all api calls where we want.


## 2. The docker-compose.yaml

Letâ€™s begin seeing what our **YAML** file for docker compose:


<Gist 
   fileName="docker-compose.yaml" 
   userName="antoniodevivo" 
   gistId="f3e15a60a4942f5e96aed6e55440e552"
/> 


To reduce the navigation complexity of the post, I divided everything into three sections, one for each post.

In each of these you will find the piece of the yaml file inherent and the explanation of the various configuration files

## 3. Reverse proxy container

### YAML part
<Gist 
   fileName="reverse-proxy.yaml" 
   userName="antoniodevivo" 
   gistId="48de21b0b7762412301368c95ea680ef"
/> 

For the **reverse proxy** container weâ€™re using a nginx v1.7 server, linking 80 and 443 ports and settings volumes for configuration and **ssl certificates**.

### nginx.conf

Letâ€™s take a look to the basic nginx configuration for reverse proxy:

<Gist 
   fileName="nginx.conf" 
   userName="antoniodevivo" 
   gistId="e9966e9dc651608b00d9b27e776bdc39"
/> 

How are mapped:

- the server catch any api call direct to **https** port on domain example.com and www.example.com
- the **location** **/** (root) is set to **re-route** http calls to http://profile_site:443
- the **location** **/blog** is set to **re-route** http calls to http://blog:443

The **sublocations** for **css**, **js** and **php** are for redirecting calls **to wordpress static files** in the right direction

**Note:** http://profile_site and http://blog are defined in docker network

Itâ€™s also present the part for redirect http request to https.

## 4. Personal site container

### YAML part

<Gist 
   fileName="personal_site.yaml" 
   userName="antoniodevivo" 
   gistId="a02d7c57c3acdc67645c0af0679a3cf2"
/> 

The /var/www/http/profile_site will be the root folder for our website

### nginx.conf

<Gist 
   fileName="nginx.conf" 
   userName="antoniodevivo" 
   gistId="1e393dbc8c139466def43ff340cfe677"
/> 


## 5. MySQL Container

### YAML part

<Gist 
   fileName="db.yaml" 
   userName="antoniodevivo" 
   gistId="c84b10bd2eeb62b84945953b86e9efe0"
/> 

Here we should consider a couple things:

- The volume **./blog/db_data **should contain all data of our database to avoid to loosing them
- The command **â€“default-authentication-plugin=mysql_native_password** **â€“innodb-flush-method=O_DSYNC** allow us to use password as authentication method

## 6. WordPress container

### YAML part

<Gist 
   fileName="blog.yaml" 
   userName="antoniodevivo" 
   gistId="75eb3d2ddc747fad469f69f9a3550f4e"
/> 

This part is also very intuitive. The files for Apache inserted in the volumes we will see them shortly.
I would like to make just a couple of clarifications:

- The **â€“ db : mysql** under **links** key itâ€™s for assign an alias for db in the docker network. It might be useful to find the container of the database more easily
- The volume **./blog/wordpress_data** will contain all wordpress site automatically, to avoid to loose data

### 000-default.conf

<Gist 
   fileName="000-default.conf" 
   userName="antoniodevivo" 
   gistId="2f54aae51ee0138c76605c4907528eb6"
/> 

A really simple file, to set the server inside the wordpress container so that it exposes only port 443 to call up our blog

### apache2.conf

<Gist 
   fileName="apache2.conf" 
   userName="antoniodevivo" 
   gistId="f711ffdcb74947bc743823aa30d4cdec"
/> 

Just add these 3 lines to have your **HTTP** calls re-routed to **HTTPS**

**Note**: the Apache rewrite module is enabled by default in the wordpress docker image. If not, follow the steps below:

- Execute **docker exec -it blog_container_name bash** from the host to enter in the container
- Run **a2enmod rewrite** for enable rewrite module
- Run **systemctl restart httpd** for reboot apache service


### ports.conf

<Gist 
   fileName="ports.conf" 
   userName="antoniodevivo" 
   gistId="2143554274df59c38de86fca323be641"
/> 

Just comment all lines or delete them for unset other access points to apache server



Thatâ€™s all!

Youâ€™ll find all the project files with some security features at this link: [https://github.com/antoniodevivo/personal_site](https://github.com/antoniodevivo/personal_site)

I have tried to make this article as **streamlined** as possible, so that you can have a **quick** dynamic on how to **set up** your deployment environment.

Iâ€™m sure you will be able to find the answers to any doubts on Google ðŸ˜‰

If not, write to me in private.


Thanks for reading the article ðŸ˜€
